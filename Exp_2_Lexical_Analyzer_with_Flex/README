###Considering...
- Question on the regular expression matching the remarks:
    - Can the regular expression` [\/][\*]([^\*])*[\*]([^\*\/](([^\*])*)[\*]|[\*])*(\/)` be replaced by
      `[\/][\*]([^\*])*([^\*\/](([^\*])*)[\*]|[\*])+(\/)`, which merged the `[\*] ` into the later section and change the `*` of the later to `+` ?
- Method to capture dismatched characters.
